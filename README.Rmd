[Open Music Europe](https://openmuse.eu/) will pioneer new best-practice methods and tools for data collection from multiple sources, and integrate these into an open-source software ecosystem that non-specialist stakeholders can use.

_Our ambition is to create an ecosystem of statistical software that is interoperable with the systems of ESSnet via the widely-used R statistical environment. On the basis of this ecosystem, we are planning a complementary, decentralised music data and intelligence hub that is complementary to both the centralised functions of the future `European Music Observatory` and the ESSnet. This intelligence hub, the Open Data Observatory, has a service level similar to that of the Eurostat Rest API (high-quality data and visualisation products with various statistical quality control available in a Rest API meeting Dublin Core, DataCite, and SDMX interoperability standards). In addition, the Open Data Observatory will fill the gaps in the offering provided by Eurostat and the ESSnet network,due to their non-music specific mandate and cost/benefit analysis._

## Request new functionality {#request-new-functionality}

Because we aim to fill data gaps with an open-source software ecosystem so that non-technical music researchers can work with them and make them available in the Open Music Observatory, we embraced and slightly modified the requirements elicitation methodology of the Polifonia Horizon Europe project; this way we could also utilise the excellent formal ontologies and tools developed by this project for music research.

In short, we ask music stakeholders to tell our experts their data "story": what is the data problem or data gap they are struggling with now, and how they would like to change it. We write a 2-3 pages "story" about the required software components to be developed in a non-technical manner. 

-   `Reproducible culral policy documents`: Requirement elicitation: Stories of [Michal](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/documents/open_music_europe/dataset-development/stories/michal.html), [Ivana](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/documents/open_music_europe/dataset-development/stories/ivana.html).
- `Connecting music databases and libraries`: Story of  [Natalia](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/documents/open_music_europe/dataset-development/stories/natalia.html).
-   `Locally relevant playlists, rights management reporting`: Story of [Max](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/documents/open_music_europe/dataset-development/stories/max.html);  [Georg](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/documents/open_music_europe/dataset-development/stories/georg.html) and  [Jana](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/documents/open_music_europe/dataset-development/stories/jana.html).

Polifonia uses the *eXtreme Design* methodology complemented with some user-experience design concepts; this method utilises software design patterns and competency questions. Using software design patterns is commonplace in object-oriented languages, and work very well in OWL/RDF/Python (used in our knowledge coordination layer), but not always straightforward in functional programming. To retain the applicability of this methodology across the different layers of our software ecosystem, the new R packages developed in Open Music Europe are object-oriented, and they utilise the relatively simple but versatile S3 object-oriented class system of the R statistical ecosystem and language.
